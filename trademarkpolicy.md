# Trademark Usage Policy

The following is a draft of the Jupyter Trademark Usage Policy. We are actively working on this document. Sections that are completed
should be considered to be a accepted and active.

## Usage of the Jupyter tradmark on merchandise

We encourage usage of the Jupyter trademark (logo and word mark) on stickers, hats, mugs, t-shirts and other physical merchandise to promote the project and the broader open-source ecosystem. No explicit
approval is needed for these usages as long as 1) the usage follows the official Jupyter Brand Guidelines and 2) the merchandise is
provided free of charge. We understand that not everyone (including ourselves) can afford to give away merchandise in sufficient
quantities to meet demand. Because of this we wold love help from the community in creating an official place to purchase Jupyter branded
merchandise with the profits going back to the project through NumFOCUS. If you are interested in helping out with this please get in
touch with us on the Jupyter Google Group. Offering Jupyter branded merchandise for sale without explicit approval is not permitted.
