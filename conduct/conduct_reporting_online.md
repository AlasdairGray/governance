# Project Jupyter Code of Conduct - Reporting Guide - Online Community

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report
it to Project Jupyter by emailing
[*conduct@jupyter.org*](mailto:conduct@jupyter.org) or by completing the
following form [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/sJzOIie3zde9M71T2). All reports
will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public
statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all
involved will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us
otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate,
please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

If you choose to email instead of using the form, please include the following
information:

* Your contact info (not required, if you would like to remain anonymous please
  use the form)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  were other witnesses besides you, try to include them as well
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a
  mailing list archive or GitHub/gitter.im) please include a link
* Any extra context you believe exists for the incident
* If you believe this incident is ongoing
* Any other information you believe we should have


## What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from the Project Jupyter Code of Conduct Committee
acknowledging receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge receipt within 24
hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:
* What happened
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
* Who the individual(s) involved were
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the committee's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This
means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation
has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the Code of Conduct Committee has a complete account of the events they
will make a decision as to how to respond.

Responses may include:

* No action (if we determine no violation occurred)
* A private reprimand from the Code of Conduct Committee to the individual(s)
  involved
* A public reprimand
* An imposed vacation (for example: asking someone to "take a week off" from a
  mailing list, GitHub, etc.)
* A temporary or permanent ban from some or all Jupyter spaces
* A request for a public or private apology
* We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
  resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't
guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, the Code of Conduct Committee will make a report on the situation to
the Jupyter Steering Council. The council may choose to publish a report of the
incident.

## Appealing the Code of Conduct Committeeâ€™s Response

Only permanent resolutions (such as bans) may be appealed. To appeal a decision
of the Code of Conduct Committee, contact the Jupyter Steering Council at
[*steeringcouncil@jupyter.org*](mailto:steeringcouncil@jupyter.org) with your
appeal and they will review the case.
