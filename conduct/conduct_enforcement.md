# Jupyter Code of Conduct - Enforcement Manual

This is the enforcement manual followed by Jupyter's Code of Conduct
Committee. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent
and fair. It should be considered an internal document, but we're publishing it
publicly in the interests of transparency.


## The Code of Conduct Committee

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a Code of
Conduct Committee ("the committee").

The Jupyter Steering Council will establish this committee, comprised of at
least five members. One member will be designated chair of the group and will be
responsible for all reports back to the Steering Council. The Steering Council
will review membership on a regular basis.

## How the committee will respond to reports

When a report is sent to the committee they will immediately reply to the reporter
to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 24 hours, and the group
should strive to respond much quicker than that.

See the [Reporting Guidelines](*conduct_reporting_online.md*) for details of
what reports should contain. If a report doesn't contain enough information, the
committee will obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is
empowered to act on the Steering Council’s behalf in contacting any individuals
involved to get a more complete account of events.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their
ability:

* What happened
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation
* Who, if anyone, was responsible for the violation
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the group's
deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. chat transcripts, email
discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).

It is important to retain an archive of all activities of this committee to
ensure consistency in behavior and provide institutional memory for the
project.

The Code of Conduct Committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within
one week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the
committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline
for resolution.


## Acting Unilaterally

If the act is ongoing, or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of
violence), any committee member may act immediately (before reaching consensus)
to address the situation. In ongoing situations, any member may decide to employ
any of the tools available to the committee, including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the committee may -- and
should -- act unilaterally to protect the safety of those involved. This can
include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on
behalf of the Jupyter Steering Council.

In situations where an individual committee member acts unilaterally, they must
report their actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.


## Resolutions

The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group cannot reach
consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will turn the matter over to
the Steering Council for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

* Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this
  case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over
  email, cc'ing the group.
* A public reprimand. In this case, the committee chair will deliver that
  reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in the gitter
  chat room for a gitter chat room violation; email for an email violation,
  etc.). The group may choose to publish this message elsewhere for
  documentation purposes.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing
  list or gitter chat room). The committee chair will communicate this
  "vacation" to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation
  voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to
  enforce this vacation.
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Jupyter spaces (mailing lists,
  gitter.im, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such bans so that
  they may be reviewed in the future or otherwise maintained.
* A request for a public or private apology. The chair will deliver this
  request. The committee may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request:
  for example, the group may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain
  one’s membership on a mailing list.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the committee will
contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the
proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this resolution is acceptable,
and must note feedback for the record. However, the committee is not required to
act on this feedback.

Finally, the committee will make a report to the Jupyter Steering Council (as
well as the Jupyter core team in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a
ban).

The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements
(aside from the responses listed above if those are on public channels) will be
made by the chair of the Code of Conduct Committee or the Jupyter Steering Council.


## Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest, a committee member must immediately
notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
